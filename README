Spreadsheet/Perl version 0.02
=============================

Spreadsheet::Perl is a pure Perl implementation of a spreadsheet.

Please look at the man page for more information

In this release:

New:
- Store calls back
- more examples
- attribute (read) access through the tied hash
- started to work on the documentation

Changes/Fixes:
- podified the pod
- sub name importing thanks to Yitzchak Scott-Thoenne (though we don't agree on the strategy yet)

TODO

Unfortunately there is still a lot to do (the basics are there) but I have
the feeling I will not get the time needed. If someone is willing to help
or take over, I'll be glad to step aside.

I put this early version on cpan in the hope to get someone interested so the
module doesn't end up in one of my never used archive CDs.

Here are some of the things that I find missing, this doesn't mean all are good ideas:
- documentation, test (working on it)
- perl debugger support à la PBS
- Row/column/spreadsheet default values.
- R1C1 Referencing
- database interface (a handfull of functions at most)
- WWW interface
- Arithmetic functions (only Sum is implemented), statistic functions
- printing, exporting
- importing from other spreadsheets
- more serious file reading and file writting
- more complex stuff (fixing one fixes the other)
	- Insertion of rows and columns
	- Deletion of rows and columns
	- Sorting
- a gui (curses, tk, wxWindows) would be great!
- a nice logo :-)

Some of the stuff needed is available on CPAN, just some glue is needed.

BUGS

Plenty, I just don't know where they are.
